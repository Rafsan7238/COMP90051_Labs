    "## Model design with `torch.nn.Module`\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll want to compare a couple of different architectures when attacking this problem. Iterating over different models in the ad-hoc manner we saw in previous workshops can quickly get messy. Model design typically (but not always!) decomposes into an _initialization phase_, where the model parameters are defined, and the _forward phase_, where the input tensors $\\mathbf{x}$ pass through the Directed Acyclic Graph of operations to produce the model output, the logits $\\Phi(\\mathbf{x})$. The canonical method of model design in PyTorch reflects this decomposition. We start with inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, which allows us to access common NN-specific functionality, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement the constructor `__init__(self, ...)`. Here we define all network parameters.\n",
    "* Override the forward method `forward(self, x)`. This accepts the input tensor `x` and returns our desired model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided your operations are autograd-compliant, the backward pass is implemented automatically as PyTorch walks the computational graph backward. Imagine if you had to manually compute your own parameter gradients - what a time-saver! We'll look at multiple examples of this today, starting with the logistic regression model we investigated last week."

    "Recall from lectures that an autoencoder is used to learn an 'efficient' or lower dimensional coding of the input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to some latent code $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The intuitive idea is that we wish to recover the high-dimensional, potentially sparse data signal represented by $\\mathbf{x}$ from some low-dimensional projection $\\mathbf{z}$. Natural images are a good example of data which is potentially very high-dimensional (for an $m \\times n$ color image, $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3mn}$ naively, but we would only expect valid inputs to lie in some relatively small subspace of the original space, which can be spanned using fewer 'meaningful' dimensions. By enforcing a lower-dimensional projection, we would like our representation to discard redundant dimensions while retaining dimensions which correspond to intrinsic aspects of the input space. Autoencoding-based models have many applications such as image/speech synthesis, super-resolution and compressed-sensing. \n",

To test if our autoencoder has learnt a well-structured latent space, one can decode a convex combination of the latent codes for datapoints, $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{x}'$. If interpolating between two points in latent space produces a meaningful image in data space that is not a pixelwise admixture of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{x'}$, this suggests that nearby points in latent space are semanatically similar - i.e. the different classes are clustered together in latent space.

    "You should find that interpolations in the latent space tends to be more structured than interpolation in the original pixel space - in the sense that it is more than just pixelwise interpolation. Each reconstructed image should resemble one class instead of an admixture of two classes. Conventional autoencoders aren't strictly the best task for this because they don't enforce any structure on the latent space. The [variational autoencoder](http://paulrubenstein.co.uk/variational-autoencoders-are-not-autoencoders/) explicitly enforces some sort of user-specified structure on the latent space and typically leads to superior latent space representations. It is one of the most prominent marriages of deep learning with traditional Bayesian methods. But this is out of the scope of the subject and we're out of time - that's all for this week!"
